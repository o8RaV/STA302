\end{abstract}

Extract of the questions from Gebru et al. (2021).

\textbf{Motivation}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific
  task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
  Please provide a description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The dataset was created to enable analysis of Australian
    politicians. We were unable to find a publicly available dataset in
    a structured format that had the biographical and political
    information on Australian politicians that was needed for modelling.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research
  group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company,
  institution, organization)?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an
  associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant
  name and number.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Any other comments?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Composition}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for
  example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
  types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people
  and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
  description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
  appropriate)?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
  sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the
  dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample
  representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)?
  If so, please describe how this representativeness was
  validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set,
  please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of
  instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{What data does each instance consist of? ``Raw'' data (for
  example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case,
  please provide a description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so,
  please provide a description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,
  please provide a description, explaining why this information is
  missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not
  include intentionally removed information, but might include, for
  example, redacted text.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Are relationships between individual instances made explicit
  (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so,
  please describe how these relationships are made explicit.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Are there recommended data splits (for example, training,
  development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description
  of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
  dataset? If so, please provide a description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise
  rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other
  datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
  there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time;
  b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that
  is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the
  dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example,
  licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that
  might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all
  external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well
  as links or other access points, as appropriate.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Does the dataset contain data that might be considered
  confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege
  or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content
  of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a
  description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be
  offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?
  If so, please describe why.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by
  age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are
  identified and provide a description of their respective distributions
  within the dataset.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more
  natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in
  combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe
  how.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive
  in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins,
  sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union
  memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or
  genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social
  security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a
  description.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Any other comments?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Collection process}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the
  data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings),
  reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly
  inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags,
  model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by
  subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data
  validated/verified? If so, please describe how.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for
  example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation,
  software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or
  procedures validated?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

  specific sampling probabilities)?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}

  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Were the individuals in question notified about the data
  collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other
  information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other

  notification itself.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and
  use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or

    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals
  provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for
  certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link
  or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TBD
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its
  use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis)
  been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis,
  including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any
  supporting documentation.}
